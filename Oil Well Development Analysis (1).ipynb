    "The oil and gas industry plays a vital role in the global economy, and efficient exploration and development of oil wells are crucial for maximizing profitability. In this project, we aim to leverage predictive modeling and risk assessment techniques to identify the most promising regions for oil well development.\n",

These files provide information on unique oil well identifiers, as well as three significant features of points. The volume of reserves in each oil well is also included, serving as the target variable for our analysis."
